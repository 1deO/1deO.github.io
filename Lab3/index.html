			<h3>The scientific name of the rock ptarmigan is Lagopus muta. This name reflects the ptarmigan's special characteristics; lagopus means "rabbit foot", referring to the heavy plumage which covers the rock ptarmigan's legs down to the talons. The species of the Lagopus genus, which lose their color to turn white in the winter, are known as ptarmigans.</h3></td>
